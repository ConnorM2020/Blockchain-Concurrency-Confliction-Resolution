# Blockchain Concurrency Confliction Resolution

An MEng Final Year Project - Blockchain platform for resolving concurrency conflicts using sharding and MVCC principles, with full visualisation, benchmarking, and persistent Firebase logging.

---

## Project Overview

This project showcases a scalable, conflict-resilient blockchain system built with a Go-based backend and a React-based frontend. It supports:

- Concurrent transaction execution
- Sharding with MVCC conflict resolution
- Interactive dashboard with ReactFlow
- Firebase integration for persistent logging and recovery
- Performance benchmarking: execution time, finality, propagation latency, TPS

---

## Why Use Sharding?

> **Scalability**: Transactions execute in parallel across shards.  
> **Performance**: Lower average execution time for sharded workloads.  
> **Conflict Isolation**: Sharding reduces concurrency bottlenecks.

##  Transaction Metrics (Visualised)

The system logs each transaction with detailed metrics:

| Metric               | Description                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `txID`              | Unique transaction identifier                          |
| `source â†’ target`   | Block-to-block routing                                 |
| `type`              | `Sharded` or `Non-Sharded`                             |
| `execTime` (ms)     | Time to execute the transaction                        |
| `finality` (ms)     | Time from submission to full confirmation              |
| `propagation` (ms)  | Network latency between blocks                         |
| `TPS`               | Transactions per second at the time of submission      |
| `timestamp`         | Time of submission                                     |

## ðŸ“Š Visual Dashboard

Transactions are pulled directly from **Firebase Firestore** and shown in ascending timestamp order:

## Firebase Integration

All transaction logs are saved to Firestore (`transactions` collection), including performance details and timestamps for analytics. This enables persistence across system restarts and supports dashboard loading from historical data.

Sample Firestore entry:
```json
{
  "txID": "tx-17443889221333985170",
  "source": 1,
  "target": 2,
  "type": "Sharded",
  "execTime": 1000.744,
  "finality": 1000.744,
  "tps": 1.0,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-05T22:40:22",
  "message": "Transaction Data",
  "propagation": 35
}
```
